- I am a data engineer/MLOps with a bachelor's degree in computer science from the National Open University of Nigeria. I have recently completed a five-month project-based internship at Hamoye.com, a leading online learning platform for data science and AI in Africa. I have developed core competencies in data collection, wrangling, analysis, visualization, and presentation, using various tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint.

At Hamoye.com, I worked on several real-world use cases from different sectors such as finance, e-commerce, and health, where I collected data from relevant sources, performed exploratory and descriptive analysis, and created interactive dashboards and reports to communicate actionable insights and recommendations to the broader team and stakeholders. I also applied machine learning techniques to unstructured data, such as text and images, to generate predictions and classifications. I am passionate about solving complex problems with data and AI, and I am eager to learn new skills and technologies that can enhance my capabilities and impact. I value collaboration, diversity, and innovation, and I believe I can bring a unique perspective and experience to the team.
